 Topic: Iterations
  1) Write a python script which will take one number as input and multiply 10 with it. As long as the user does not enter a valid number, the program will keep prompting the user to enter a number.
  2) Write a python script which takes one number as an input and outputs a pyramid taking the number as the height. If the input is invalid, it prints an upside down pyramid of height 5.
  3) Write a python script which will take one input. As long as the entered value is not “I am a password”, the script will prompt the user to enter the input again. If the input matches, the script will print “You are in!”
  4) Write a python script which takes one number as an input and outputs an “X” taking the number as the height. If the input is invalid, it prints a square of height 5. All even numbers are invalid inputs as well.
