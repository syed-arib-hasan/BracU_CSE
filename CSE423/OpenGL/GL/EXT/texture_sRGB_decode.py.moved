'''OpenGL extension EXT.texture_sRGB_decode

This module customises the behaviour of the 
OpenGL.raw.GL.EXT.texture_sRGB_decode to provide a more 
Python-friendly API

Overview (from the spec)
	
	The ARB_texture_sRGB extension provides a texture format stored in the
	sRGB color space. Sampling one of these textures will always return the
	color value decoded into a linear color space. However, an
	application may wish to sample and retrieve the undecoded sRGB data from the
	texture and manipulate that directly.
	
	This extension adds a Texture Parameter and Sampler Object parameter to
	allow sRGB textures to be read directly, without decoding.
	
	The new parameter, TEXTURE_SRGB_DECODE_EXT controls whether the 
	decoding happens at sample time. It only applies to textures with an 
	internal format that is sRGB and is ignored for all other textures. 
	This value defaults to DECODE_EXT, which indicates the texture 
	should be decoded to linear color space.

The official definition of this extension is available here:
