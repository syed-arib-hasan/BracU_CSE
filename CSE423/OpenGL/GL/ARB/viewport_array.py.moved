'''OpenGL extension ARB.viewport_array

This module customises the behaviour of the 
OpenGL.raw.GL.ARB.viewport_array to provide a more 
Python-friendly API

Overview (from the spec)
	
	OpenGL is modeled on a pipeline of operations. The final stage in this
	pipeline before rasterization is the viewport transformation. This stage
	transforms vertices from view space into window coordinates and allows the
	application to specify a rectangular region of screen space into which
	OpenGL should draw primitives. Unextended OpenGL implementations provide a
	single viewport per context. In order to draw primitives into multiple
	viewports, the OpenGL viewport may be changed between several draw calls.
	With the advent of Geometry Shaders, it has become possible for an
	application to amplify geometry and produce multiple output primitives
	for each primitive input to the Geometry Shader. It is possible to direct
	these primitives to render into a selected render target. However, all
	render targets share the same, global OpenGL viewport.
	
	This extension enhances OpenGL by providing a mechanism to expose multiple
	viewports. Each viewport is specified as a rectangle. The destination
	viewport may be selected per-primitive by the geometry shader. This allows
	the Geometry Shader to produce different versions of primitives destined
	for separate viewport rectangles on the same surface. Additionally, when
	combined with multiple framebuffer attachments, it allows a different
	viewport rectangle to be selected for each. This extension also exposes a
	separate scissor rectangle for each viewport. Finally, the viewport bounds
	are now floating point quantities allowing fractional pixel offsets to be
	applied during the viewport transform.
